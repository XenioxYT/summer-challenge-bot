2. `!all_challenges`: Lists all challenges in the database.

3. `!user_stats [user]`: Retrieves statistics for a user.

4. `!random_challenge [user]`: Selects a random challenge for a user.

5. `!complete [challenge name]`: Marks a challenge as completed for a user.

6. `!leaderboard`: Displays the leaderboard of all users.

7. `!progress [user1] [user2] ...`: Shows the progress of a user or a group of users.

8. `!remaining [user]`: Shows the remaining challenges for a user.

9. `!search [keyword]`: Search for challenges.

10. `!delete_challenge [challenge]`: Delete a challenge. Example: `!delete_challenge [challenge name]`.
